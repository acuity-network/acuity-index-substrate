# Grant 2 Milestone 4 Testing Guide

To run the unit tests:

```
git clone https://github.com/hybrid-explorer/hybrid-indexer
cd hybrid-indexer
git checkout milestone-2.4
cargo test

git clone https://github.com/hybrid-explorer/hybrid-api-rs
cd hybrid-api-rs
git checkout milestone-2.4
cargo test
```


Build the polkadot-indexer docker image (this takes a long time) and run it:

```
git clone https://github.com/hybrid-explorer/polkadot-indexer/
cd polkadot-indexer
git checkout milestone-2.4
docker build .
docker run -p 8172:8172 -it [image_hash] /bin/bash
./target/release/polkadot-indexer -i --queue-depth 1
```

Due to rate limiting, indexing public endpoints must have a depth queue of 1 and is therefore much slower than indexing a local node. Indexing a local node has been observed at 1,500 blocks per second with a higher queue depth.

In a separate terminal, install hybrid-cli:

```
cargo +nightly install hybrid-cli
```

## Deliverable 1,2 - Status subscription

Run the following command:

```
hybrid --url ws://127.0.0.1:8172 subscribe-status
```

Observe that when a new head block is indexed a list of indexed spans is outputted. Press ctrl+c to stop. It will unsubscribe before exiting.

Run the following command:

```
hybrid --url ws://127.0.0.1:8172 subscribe-events variant -p 0 -v 0
```

Observe that when a new block is indexed the block number and event index of any ExtrinsicSuccess events is outputted. Press ctrl+c to stop. It will unsubscribe before exiting.

## Deliverable 3 - Report each index size

Run the following command:

```
hybrid --url ws://127.0.0.1:8172 size-on-disk
```

Observe that the size on disk is outputted.

## Deliverable 4 - Rust API

The documentation for the Hybrid API library can be found here: https://docs.rs/hybrid-api/latest/hybrid_api/

The Hybrid CLI source code shows how to use it: https://github.com/hybrid-explorer/hybrid-cli/blob/master/src/main.rs
